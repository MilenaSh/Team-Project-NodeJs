# Team-Project-NodeJs
Team project for Nodejs course of Team Watchmen.

## TODO:

- Edit profile to change profile avatar with multer
- Testssssssssss
- Find out if by changing data, users or courses have to be updated somewhere
- Add a custom 404 page middleware (add after all others) for non-specified routes
- Work on design + add footer
- Upload to Amazon

## To Fix:

- Search bar sends empty result on enter key press
- Validation for register, login and edit profile fields
- Like buttons (most popular and most recent should be liked at the same time)
- Maybe use the unauthorized.pug instead of writing unauthorized in other pug files
