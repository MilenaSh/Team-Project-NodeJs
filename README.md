# Team-Project-NodeJs
Team project for Nodejs course of Team Watchmen.

## TODO:

Initial notes and ideas for the project.

  HOW WE DESPLAY STAFF:
  
  *HOME PAGE : Jumbotron + Catalog search field.
  Bellow we display the courses on a random princip without filtering.
  
  NB: We can make specific categories such as - "Most popular"; "New classes" etc on the initial page.
  
  SEARCH: We can make a name matching search but also filtering by categories, course duration, course rate etc.
  
  LOGIN / SIGN UP FORMS - should think how to display them
  
  FOR EACH COURSE we display a separate page with:
  
  - Course details
  - Taught by
  - Rating
  - Syllabus
  
  .......
  NB: We should think if displying all in one page or with subpages/ menu to access the different resources
  The display for logged in / and or signed in user should be different
  - the signed in user should have additional resources - ex. access to the forum of the course or to the videos.
  
  
  **USER PROFILE / LEVELS OF AUTHENTICATION
  
  As we should have different levels of authorisation and access we will have different disply for existing logged in user and for a new/ not logged in user.
  
  NEW/ NOT EXISTING
  - Can look for courses but cannot watch the videos
  
  EXISTING PROFILE
  - full access when logged in
  - list of courses he is signed for
  - Edit profile option 

!!!NB : Need to discuss how to separate the modules :) 
  
 To be continued....
  

So far and current questions:

- Configured eslintrc file
- use of npm (not yarn)
- use of isomorphic-fetch ? - to check if it works for us


## To Fix:

Search bar sends empty result on enter key press
